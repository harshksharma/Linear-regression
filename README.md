# Linear-regression
This repository contains a project demonstrating the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model using Python. The project is structured around a dataset Salary.csv, which includes data on years of experience and corresponding salaries.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience using a simple linear regression model. This project serves as a foundational example for understanding and applying linear regression in machine learning.

Dataset
The dataset Salary.csv includes the following columns:
YearsExperience: A numerical value representing the years of experience.
Salary: An integer value representing the salary corresponding to the experience.
The dataset contains 35 entries with no missing values.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset.
Implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python.
Visualization of the regression line and data points.
Evaluation of the model's performance.

File Structure
harshkumarsharma_linear_regression_template.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the Simple Linear Regression model.
Salary.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.

Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Results
The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of building a simple linear regression model, including visualizations of the regression line and model evaluation metrics.
